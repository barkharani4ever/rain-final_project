--> This application allows users to register for an account and log in
--> Once logged in, users can upload songs under "Song Management" tab.
    Unfortunately, I get an error when I do so.
--> However, the users can add songs manually under "Song Management (dt)" tab by clicking on the '+' button next to actions.
--> Once a song is added, the user can edit it or delete it.
